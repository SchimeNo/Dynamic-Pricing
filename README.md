DYNAMIC PRICING PROJECT
-
by Eloi Cirera, Sergi Chimeno, Sara Mar√≠n from UBIQUM
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION: 
	Part1: Demand forecast from a time series using RandomForest and other regression models instead of time series due having a not long enough data. 
   
---------------------------------------------------------------------

BEFORE STARTING

May need to install and prepare your enviroment for the H2O package.

SCRIPTS DESCRIPTION

All scripts should be in a folder called scripts and all data in a folder called datasets.

01_FEATURE_CREATION_for_PricingHub.R

Contains new_feature function that will create the new features used in our project.

	- DATE Variables: The date has been splitted by YEAR, QUARTER, MONTH, WEEK, WEEKDAY and DAY

	- MONTH_NO: (numeric) feature counting the months. 

	- DIFF: (numeric) increment of y of a day respect the previous day

	- INCREMENT_YEAR: (numeric) increment of y respect the same day from the previous year

	- ROLLMEANS: (numeric) Rolling means Feature (previous 7 days)

	- SPECIAL_DAYS: (logic/binary) feature where 0=NORMAL / 1=SPECIAL DAY
  			1 if the mean of the last 7 days is bigger than 7000 or 
  			the difference between previous day is bigger than 2000

	- HOLIDAYS: (numeric from [0-8]) giving a weight from 0 to 8 according the number of visits)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
02_MODEL_COMPETITION_for_PricingHub.R

This is the heaviest script, it takes an average of 5 to 10 minutes to run, ideally you will only need to run it every year or 3-6 months to store and check the results of the new data updated. 

INPUT: Time Series of demand (ds, y)

OUTPUT:   

	- Results.rds: List that stores the results of all the models
	- BEST_MODEL.rds: Dataframe with the optimal window model by month 

DESCRIPTION: 

Contains two for loops that trains the model deppending on the MONTH WE WANT TO PREDICT and the WINDOW OF MONTHS we used to train it. 

	For example:  to predict February 19  it tries all combinations possible and BEST_MODEL stores the best one (with the lowest  MAE)

The script has the option of easily changing the model (Random Forest, GBM, SVM or any other models you would like to try, careful because the code may change if you are using the H2O package or not). DEFAULT MODEL USED IN THIS SCRIPT IS RANDOM FOREST.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

03_DEFINITIVE_MODEL_for_PricingHub

This should be the main script used to predict the following month. 
INPUT:  
	- Time Series of demand (ds, y) (from 01-01-2018 to current date)
	- BEST_MODEL.rds 
	- new_feature.R script 
	- YEAR: Manually put the year you want to predict.
	- MONTH: Manually put the specific month you want to predict.

OUTPUT:
	- PREDICTION: Time Series data with the predicted demand of that MONTH. (If the time series has not been updated it may give you an error)

First it will create an empty time series for the predicted month. 
Then it will look at the BEST_RESULT dataset to see which window of months work better, it will specify the window and then apply the model.
It should return a time series with the demand by day.
